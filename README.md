## GenderIndicator
### A Userscript for Facebook
name is a work in progress

The purpose of this script is to allow Facebook users to share their preferred name and pronouns
with other script users and/or be able to view this information for others.

With the script active, the Facebook names of users who have filled out the form and added
themselves to the database will be replaced with their name and if desired their pronouns when
other users hover over their name on the desktop version of Facebook.

To add your name and pronouns to the database you only need to fill out the form with your
Facebook ID (found at the end of your page URL). This can be done any number of times and
only the most recent will be used. You do not have to use the userscript to add your name
and pronouns to the database for users who whish to see them.

[The form can be found here](http://goo.gl/forms/GjVJpF5C8I)

Only other users of the script will be able to see that you are using it. Submitting the form
will not change the way any part of your facebook profile appears to anyone other that people
who are using the GenderIndicator script.

To use the features of the script on Facebook you will need to install a browser add-on, either
Greasemonkey (on Firefox) or Tampermonkey (on Chrome). Unfortunately, the script is currently
not available for Internet Explorer. These add-ons are not security risks, but it is possible
for malicious scripts to be run from them. You must give any and all scripts explicit
permission to install and to run. They cannot be installed without your knowledge. I can
assure users that the scripts found on this repository do not have any behaviors intended to
harm your system or steal your information.

[Download Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

[Download Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

With the add-on installed, you will be able to load the userscript by clicking [this link](https://github.com/LpH3/facebook-GenderIndicator/raw/master/facebook-gender-indicator.user.js).
The script should auto-update.

At this moment, the script is only effective on the browser version of Facebook, and makes use
of the "notecard" feature. Later version may attempt to include more features, including
ones that might be functional on Android browsers (but most likely not the Facebook app).
