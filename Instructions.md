##Instructions

To use the features of the script on Facebook you will need to install a browser add-on, either Greasemonkey (on Firefox) or Tampermonkey (on Chrome). Unfortunately, the script is currently not available for Internet Explorer. These add-ons are not security risks, but it is possible for malicious scripts to be run from them. You must give any and all scripts explicit permission to install and to run. They cannot be installed without your knowledge. I can assure users that the scripts found on this repository do not have any behaviors intended to harm your system or steal your information.

Download Greasemonkey

Download Tampermonkey

With the add-on installed, you will be able to load the userscript by clicking the link below.

Get the script

Later on you should be able to update the script through your add-on. By default it will update for you on its own.
